Compiler notes

compiler is like a translater 
it convert the code into assembly

code -> (compiler)-> Assembly ->(assembler) -> object file ->(linker) combine libraries with the object code-> executable

## NASM for assembler and GNU linker for linker 


## to build the compiler

baby <input.by>
arjav-jain@arjav-jain-Inspiron-15-3520:~/Coding/baby$ ./build/baby temp.by //it genrates the assembly code, object file and executable only
arjav-jain@arjav-jain-Inspiron-15-3520:~/Coding/baby$ ./out // it runs the executable file
arjav-jain@arjav-jain-Inspiron-15-3520:~/Coding/baby$ echo $? // it shows the exit code of the executable file



Tokenaizer->parsing->code creation



Tokenaizer 
it parse the input into the tokens


parsing   (parse tree)
it analyse the token sequence to determine its grammatical structure with respect to a given formal grammar 


code creation
